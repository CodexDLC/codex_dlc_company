## PAGE HERO

kicker: 02 // AUTOMATION
title: Your Business Accepts Clients. Even While You Sleep.
text: A missed call is a lost client. We set up a system that automatically accepts inquiries, filters spam, books clients, and reminds them of their visit. Without your involvement.

---

## WHO IT'S FOR

title: Who Needs This Most

card_1_title: Salons and Studios
card_1_text: Booking with a specific master, filtering by available slots — no overlaps or double bookings.

card_2_title: Craftsmen and Handwerker
card_2_text: Request for measurement or visit directly via the website or Telegram — you receive a notification and confirm with one button.

card_3_title: Cafes and Services
card_3_text: Table booking, pre-order, or service booking — the client chooses the time, you just show up and work.

## HOW IT WORKS

title: Three Scenarios That Solve Real Pain Points

### Scenario 1 — Smart Booking
label: ONLINE BOOKING
title: Client Booked. You Notified. Done.
text: The client opens the website or writes in Telegram — they see only actually free slots of the required master. They choose a time, confirm — you receive a notification in your messenger. No overlaps, no double bookings.
feat_1: Slot filtering by master and service
feat_2: Occupied time is hidden — client cannot select a busy slot
feat_3: Instant notification to the owner in Telegram or WhatsApp
feat_4: Automatic confirmation to the client via email

### Scenario 2 — Reminders
label: REDUCING NO-SHOWS
title: Client Didn't Forget. Because We Reminded Them.
text: The system automatically sends a reminder 24 hours and 2 hours before the visit. The client confirms with one button or reschedules. You know in advance who is coming and who is not.
feat_1: 24-hour reminder — automatic
feat_2: 2-hour reminder — with a confirmation button
feat_3: Cancellation → slot becomes available immediately
feat_4: No-show statistics — see the full picture of your clients

### Scenario 3 — Lead Qualification
label: LEAD FILTERING
title: Only Real Clients. No Spam.
text: The bot asks the client a few questions before booking — which service, when convenient, contact info. Spam and irrelevant inquiries are filtered out automatically. You get only ready-to-go clients.
feat_1: FSM scenario — bot guides the client step-by-step
feat_2: Irrelevant inquiries filtered before they reach you
feat_3: Client data delivered in a convenient format
feat_4: Integration with your calendar and client database
